# Python Keylogger 🖥️🔐

This is a simple keylogger written in Python using the `pynput` module. It logs all keystrokes with timestamps and stops recording when ESC is pressed.

## Features

- Adds a timestamp to each key
- Stops logging on ESC
- Runs silently with `.exe` (via PyInstaller)

## Usage
```bash
python keylogger.py
